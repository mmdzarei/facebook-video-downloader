# facebook-video-downloader-bot
This bot gets a facebook link and uploads it to the user
This is an old code, clean it up on your own

Add telegram token to **line 33** add trusted users to **line 38**, and add admin(bot owner's telegram user_id to **line 94**)

This was tested on python3.8

The code is messy, use it on your own risk please.

HD downloader does not work due to facebook xpath change.
